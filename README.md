# AzureChatBot-Covid-Data
## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a chatbot that provides answers to frequently asked questions about COVID-19 and vaccinations. The chatbot is built on Azure's Bot Service and Language Understanding (LUIS), leveraging the power of Azure AI to provide accurate, up-to-date information sourced from reputable health organizations.

## Features
- Responds to user inquiries about COVID-19 symptoms, prevention, and vaccine availability.
- Utilizes Azure Cognitive Services for natural language processing and understanding.
- Can be integrated into multiple platforms such as websites, messaging apps, and social media platforms.

## How It Works
The chatbot uses a pre-trained model on Azure LUIS to understand user intent and provide relevant answers. It pulls information from a knowledge base that includes data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Penn Medicine (MD).

## Getting Started
To get started with the COVID-19 FAQ Chatbot, you'll need to set up a few Azure services:

1. **Azure Bot Service**: Create a new bot resource on Azure.
2. **Language Understanding (LUIS)**: Import the pre-built LUIS application for intent recognition.
3. **QnA Maker**: Set up a QnA Maker service to manage your knowledge base.

### Prerequisites
- An Azure subscription(Free Tier works with this chatbot)
- Basic knowledge of bot framework and Azure services
- [Optional] Knowledge of REST APIs for custom integration
